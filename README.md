Marketing Campaign Effectiveness
Overview
The Marketing Campaign Effectiveness project analyzes and visualizes customer data from a marketing campaign. The goal is to assess the effectiveness of the campaign through key performance indicators (KPIs), and provide interactive visualizations to help stakeholders understand the customer distribution, income segmentation, education and marital status patterns, and more.

This project uses Python, Dash, and Plotly to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard allows filtering the data by country and visualizes insights on the marketing campaign's impact across different regions.

Income Distribution: Displays a histogram of customer income (normalized to a range of 0-100K).
Education and Marital Status Distribution: Bar charts showing the most common education levels and marital statuses.
Customer Distribution Map: A choropleth map visualizing customer distribution by country based on their income.

Python: Core programming language for data processing and visualization.
Dash: Framework for building web applications with Python.
Plotly: Library for creating interactive plots.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
